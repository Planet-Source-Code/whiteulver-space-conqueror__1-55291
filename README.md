### Description

This is a shoot 'em up game similar to projectX.

It was created with bitblt functions and all the others functions from the gdi32.dll.

It is not with full comments but i 'll do it if you ask for it. Anyway i wish you have fun with this game and vote me if you like it.

The graphics aren't mine. I found them on the internet. I didn't have time to create my own.
